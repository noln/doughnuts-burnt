# doughnuts-burnt
A simple Garmin IQ app for the Fenix 5X fitness GPS watch that shows the number of doughnuts burnt so far today.

On a spare Saturday night, I remembered a joke someone made at Cartems on the way back from a triathlon training weekend about how there should be a widget that shows you how many doughnuts you're allowed based on how many calories you've burnt so far in a day.

Well, now there is one!

Using Eclipse and Monkey C is a bit tricky, as things don't always work as intuitively as you'd expect, so I thought I'd share this project on here in case someone else is looking for a basic widget example for the Garmin Connect IQ platform.

<br/>(P.S: Excuse the incorrect US spelling; it just fits better on the display than the correct <em>"doughnut"</em> üòù)
